12V = 1.25
9V  = 1
5VA = 1
5V  = 1.25 for main line but like for diode 0.8 
3V3 = 0.8 
via wire = 0.25
bt_vcc = 5V
imu_vcc = 3V3

min clearance = 0.5
min pad = 1.9

encoder, uart(communication wire) = must twist

mostly use jst and db instead of usb connector

In schematic do label not global label
put values properly

place componets near as possible for less routing wire length

Make grid size of 1.27mm 
PLace 104nF capacitor across parallel of 5V and Gnd that may be either in input, communication or interrupt.
